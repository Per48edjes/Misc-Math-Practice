\section*{Problem}

Show that for any positive integer $n$, there exists a positive multiple of $n$ that contains only the digits $7$ and $0$.

\section*{Solution}


Consider the set of positive integers $\lbrace 7, 77, 777, 7777, \ldots \rbrace$. 
By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be two elements in this set that have the same remainder when divided by $n$. 
Let $a$ and $b$ be two such numbers, with $a > b$. Then $a - b$ is a positive multiple of $n$ that contains only the digits $7$ and $0$.
