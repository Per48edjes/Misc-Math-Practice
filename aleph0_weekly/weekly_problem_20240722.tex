\section*{Problem}

Show that if $n$ has an odd divisor greater than $1$, then $2^{n} + 1$ is not prime.

\section*{Solution}

\begin{proof}

  We assume $n$ has an odd divisor greater than $1$ and show that $2^{n} + 1$ is not prime.

  By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, $n$ has a unique prime factorization $n = 2^{k_{0}}3^{k_{1}}5^{k_{2}} \cdots $. 
  Let $P_{\text{odd}} = 3^{k_{1}}5^{k_{2}} \cdots > 1$ and $b = 2^{2^{k_{0}}}$, then $2^{n} = b^{P_{\text{odd}}}$.
  Notice that $P_{\text{odd}}$ is odd. Therefore, $2^{n} + 1 = b^{P_{\text{odd}}} + 1 \equiv -1 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{b + 1}$.
  Hence, if $n$ has an odd divisor greater than $1$, then $2^{n} + 1$ is not prime.
  
\end{proof}
